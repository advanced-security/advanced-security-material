# Synthetic Applications Guide

## What are Synthetic Applications?

Synthetic applications are a type of application that is not a real application but is created for the purpose of testing and validating the functionality of a SAST solution.
They are often used in scenarios where real applications are not available or practical to use, such as in testing environments or for demonstration purposes.
