# Autobuild failures

## ERROR: In --require-hashes mode, all requirements must have their versions pinned with ==.

Error/Warning in the workflow logs like:

```yml

This is likely due to a python/pypi/pip version mismatch.  Ensure you configure your proper version required to build via [actions/setup-python](https://github.com/actions/setup-python/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#using-the-python-version-input)
- see [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72980455/343347)

To resolve, specify your required versions before the codeql-action/init step:
```yml
#Set python version
- uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.9' 
    cache: 'pip' # caching pip dependencies
#Downgrade to specific pip version
-run: python -m pip install pip==22.0.4
```

Alternatively, you can disable the auto-install dependency functionality. You will need to configure the build requirements/commands from your existing CI.  Specify that codeql should disable the python automatic package restoration and run the CI tooling / commands directly before the analysis step as shown [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#analyzing-python-dependencies).
```yml
          # Override the default behavior so that the action doesn't attempt
          # to auto-install Python dependencies
          setup-python-dependencies: false
```
