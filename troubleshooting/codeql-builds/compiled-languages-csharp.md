This error indicates there is a scenario where our [C# AutoBuilder](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-the-codeql-workflow-for-compiled-languages#c) is unable to build your code.  No sweat, check out some of the resources below to get you started:

Ensure your required build tooling is installed your [runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)
   - Windows 2019 runner 
      - [Visual Studio 2019 Enterprise pre-installed](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md#visual-studio-enterprise-2019)
	  - [.NET Framework Developer Pack](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md#net-framework)
	  - [.NET Core SDK](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2019-Readme.md#net-core-sdk)
   - Windows 2022 runner 
      - [Visual Studio 2022 Enterprise pre-installed](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md#visual-studio-enterprise-2022)
	  - [.NET Framework Developer Pack](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md#net-framework)
	  - [.NET Core SDK](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md#net-core-sdk)
</details>

If any custom tooling is required, consider pulling into your action via [custom script](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/customizing-github-hosted-runners)


### DotNet (.NET standard / core )
Using `dotnet` is best documented at: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-net.  The [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet) action can assist in configuring proper build tools.

#### NuGet Error NU1301
This can indicate your custom package server is not configured which may fail the `dotnet restore` command.  For private package servers, the follwing guidance shows how to add package sources: [Setting up authentication for nuget feeds](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet#setting-up-authentication-for-nuget-feeds)

#### NuGet.targets(132,5): warning : Your request could not be authenticated by the GitHub Packages service. Please ensure your access token is valid and has the appropriate scopes configured.

The `actions/setup-dotnet` action supports [setting up authentication for nuget feeds](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet#setting-up-authentication-for-nuget-feeds). Add this before the `autobuild` / custom build steps in your workflow:
```yml
- uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
  with:
    source-url: https://nuget.pkg.github.com/<owner>/index.json
  env:
    NUGET_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
```

Alternatively, consider adding auth for your GitHub Packages hosted NuGet feed using the nuget CLI tooling.  

```yml 
  - name: add nuget auth
    run: dotnet nuget add source https://nuget.pkg.github.com/<org-goes-here>/index.json -n "GitHub" -u USERNAME -p "${{ secrets.GH_PACKAGES_READ_ONLY }}" --store-password-in-clear-text
 ```

### .NET Framework 

#### NuGet Authentication
Utilize the [nuget/setup-nuget](https://github.com/nuget/setup-nuget#basic) action to pass package key/source to nuget exe.

```yml
- uses: nuget/setup-nuget@v1
  with:
    nuget-api-key: ${{ secrets.NuGetAPIKey }}
```

#### Manual Build Steps on Windows Runners
NOTE: if you require windows OS to build, ensure you are using a windows runner. 

Example using `windows-latest`:
- Note: The `-latest` runner images are the latest stable images that GitHub provides, and might not be the most recent version of the operating system available from the operating system vendor.
```yml
jobs:
  analyze:
    name: Analyze
    runs-on: windows-latest
```

Next, consider specifying your own build steps from an existing CI workflow:
- The [microsoft/setup-msbuild](https://github.com/microsoft/setup-msbuild) and [Nuget/setup-nuget](https://github.com/nuget/setup-nuget) actions are popular tools to assist in this configuration


```yml
    # Autobuild attempts to build any compiled languages  (C/C++, C#, or Java).
    # If this step fails, then you should remove it and run the build manually (see below)
    #- name: Autobuild
    #  uses: github/codeql-action/autobuild@v2

    # Discover where the MSBuild tool is and automatically add it to the PATH environment variable
    - name: Setup MSBuild
      uses: microsoft/setup-msbuild@v1

    # Download/installs a given version of NuGet.exe. Using this action will add nuget to your $PATH
    - name: Setup NuGet
      uses: NuGet/setup-nuget@v1

    # CI build with best practices from: https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-codeql-databases/#specifying-build-commands
    - name: .NET Build Steps
      run: |
        nuget restore .\FullDotNetWebApp.sln -DisableParallelProcessing
        msbuild .\FullDotNetWebApp.sln /p:UseSharedCompilation=false /t:rebuild /p:Platform="Any CPU" /p:Configuration="Debug" /p:MvcBuildViews=true
     
    - name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
      uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

##  "You are running out of disk space.  The runner will stop working when the machine runs out of disk space."
	
Running low on disk using the default Actions runner? 

GitHub also offers larger runners, which are available in larger disk configurations. For more information, see "[About larger runners.](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-larger-runners#machine-specs-for-larger-runners)"
- See also: [Vertical Scaling](#vertical-scaling---throw-hardware-at-the-software-problem)

Alternatively, try a few of these workarounds for a potential quick fix:

Specify the OS Disk's (C:\) temp directory to store the CodeQL database.  There is a slower disk speed tradeoff compared to using the Data Disk (D:\)
 ```yml
- name: Initialize CodeQL
  uses: github/codeql-action/init@v2
  with:
  db-location: ‘C:\windows\temp\codeql-database’
```

Clean up large directories of [preinstalled software](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#preinstalled-software) that you are not using on the windows runner OS Disk.  Add this to your “CodeQL” workflow:
```yml			
- name: Clean up some disks
  run: |
  rd C:\Android\android-sdk
  docker system prune -af
```

## MvcBuildViews target failures

This can manifest through a variety of errors
- `error ASPPARSE`
- `[error]C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\Config\web.config(113,0): Error ASPCONFIG: Could not load type`
- `Error ASPCONFIG: It is an error to use a section registered as allowDefinition='MachineToApplication' beyond application level.`
- `(AfterBuildCompiler target) -> <path>web.config(##): error ASPCONFIG: Could not load file or assembly '...' or one of its dependencies. The located assembly's manifest definition does not match the assembly reference. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131040)`
- `(MvcBuildViews target) -> <path>\web.config(##):error ASPCONFIG: Could not load file or assembly '...' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.`
- `(MvcBuildViews target) -> ASPNETCOMPILER : error ASPCONFIG: Could not load file or assembly '...' or one of its dependencies. An attempt was made to load a program with an incorrect format. `

The CodeQL compiler tracer used for `csharp` will auto inject the `/p:MvcBuildViews=true` flag.  This pre-compilation of Views gives us the ability to extract the generated code from those files, leading to (potentially) better error reporting and location information if a query does flag an issue. The lack of view information passing through CodeQL to the compiler will lead to an incomplete database, where important dataflow sources/sinks/taint-steps are not included in the analysis.

The recommendation here is to ensure that passing `/p:MvcBuildViews=true` to your CI build will compile even outside of CodeQL. Having a developer reivew this on their local machine is the best scenario. This can be on done on the specific web project by adding `<MvcBuildViews>true</MvcBuildViews>` to the local .csproj ( you will often find this defaulted to false).   The MVC full framework steps are listed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/jimlamb/turn-on-compile-time-view-checking-for-asp-net-mvc-projects-in-tfs-build-2010). There are a few different reasons why this can cause your project to fail compilation.

For `Error ASPCONFIG: It is an error to use a section registered as allowDefinition='MachineToApplication' beyond application level.`,  change the locations of the obj and publish folder to not be located under the project folder of the website.  If you have bin/obj files checked into source then this could be a likely culprit: https://gunnarpeipman.com/aspnet-mvc-allowdefinition-machinetoapplication/.  You will find [various permutations of this recommendation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12778088/allowdefinition-machinetoapplication-error-setting-mvcbuildviewstrue-mvcbui) out there! 

For `Error ASPCONFIG: Could not load type 'X.Y.Z'`, ensure that you do not have excluded `.cshtml`, `.ashx`, `.ashx.cs`, `.aspx` or `.aspx.cs` files on disk in existing `Views` folders or the Root folder of your project!  You can show hidden files in your solution view to hunt these down and remove from these folders.  MvcBuildViews does not observe the file include from the csproj when compiling the application. You may have to hunt these down one by one, so adding `<MvcBuildViews>true</MvcBuildViews>` to your local .csproj may help you get this done on your local machine with Visual Studio.  The `Error List` view in Visual Studio will have a column that shows you the actual File name you need to delete.

To avoid building and scanning any view code in your project (potential false negatives in the scan as view engine code may not be evaluated for vulnerabilities) and to workaround the requirement that MvcBuildViews is automatically injected.  Consider this [community contributed suggestion](https://github.com/github/codeql/issues/11890#issuecomment-1496970164):

```powershell
# tweaking the csproj file with powershell during the build so that the hard-coded target condition "gets fooled", basically. Something like this:

$filePath = (Join-Path $pwd '\SUBFOLDER\YOURCSPROJFILE.csproj')
$csproj = [xml](Get-Content $filePath)
$buildTargetNode = $csproj.Project.Target | ? name -eq "MvcBuildViews"
$buildTargetNode.SetAttribute("Condition", "'`$(MvcBuildViews)'=='false'")
$csproj.Save($filePath)
```

Recommendations:
 - If not using GitHub Actions - ensure the CodeQL process is given appropriate amount of RAM.  This scenario has been reproduced when running out of memory. It is recommended to leave the operating system at least 1.5 GB + 2% of total memory for a Windows CI machine. (example: if the machine has 64 GB RAM total memory pass 59.7 GB `61132` to CodeQL - see CodeQL action [getSystemReservedMemoryMegaBytes](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/43750fe4fc4f068f04f2215206e6f6a29c78c763/src/util.ts#L160))
 -  edit the `.csproj` that is failing and specify the `GenerateResourceMSBuildArchitecture` property as is done in a sample [here](https://github.com/XAMLMarkupExtensions/WPFLocalizeExtension/blob/cc4799a1336afba1adfd26212a778eac28a5f79c/src/WPFLocalizeExtension.csproj#L31-L32) as [explained in resgen discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/346#issuecomment-257654120). 

```xml
        <!--Workaround for Error    MSB4216    Could not run the “GenerateResource” -->
<GenerateResourceMSBuildArchitecture>CurrentArchitecture</GenerateResourceMSBuildArchitecture>
```


# Speed up C# Analysis

Start here: [CodeQL Docs -  The build takes too long](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow#the-build-takes-too-long).


## Optimization - Removing Code From Scans
CodeQL will extract and analyze any code that is passed through the compiler.  Consider excluding any code you do not wish to include in a security scan to speed up and remove noise from this process. This is commonly employed for unit tests, demo code, or code that would not benefit from being scanned (ex: DacPacs).

With .NET we can employ a few mechanisms to remove code from CodeQL scans (e.g. you would want to run your unit test in another workflow ):
- A [solution filter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/solution-filters?view=vs-2019) to only build required projects
- An explicit [solution file that excludes projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-exclude-projects-from-a-build?view=vs-2022)
   - example from the Open Source project: [Identity Server](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/)
      - have a [build.sh script wrapper](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/blob/main/build/Program.cs#L47) around their solution targets
	  - distinct [IdentityServer.CodeQL.sln solution](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/blob/main/Duende.IdentityServer.CodeQL.sln) excluding unit tests
	  - [CodeQL yaml passes in a flag to build script](https://github.com/DuendeSoftware/IdentityServer/blob/44d8d5964edfae20c4be424c0b3a2ed5050c6fe9/.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml#L57) to use the CodeQL solution
- Build in release mode - exclude test projects from that [build configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015/ide/how-to-create-and-edit-configurations?view=vs-2015&redirectedfrom=MSDN#to-modify-a-solution-wide-build-configuration)

## Optimizations - CodeQL Engine
- CodeQL will (by default) pull in source code from your dependencies using CIL extraction to assist in mapping out your data flows. While this can  improve the precision of the results, this can also lead to a large increase in database size.  You might consider disabling this feature for a quick scan but running a cron based scan with the option enabled.

### GitHub Actions
```yml  
env:
  CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_CSHARP_OPTION_CIL: false
```
### Azure DevOps Pipelines
```yml  
variables:  
  # Disable CodeQL CSharp CIL mode
  CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_CSHARP_OPTION_CIL: false
```



## Optimizations - CodeQL Queries
- Tweak your current codeql yml workflow in a few ways: 
	- remove security-extended queries, the default query pack `code-scanning` has a smaller set of optimized queries and will complete faster
		- As of [v2.10.5](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-20220908) - Query Suite Counts
			- code-scanning (default) - 49 queries
			- security-extended - 66 queries
			- security-and-quality - 171 queries

- Micro Optimizations: Consider these as a potential quick hit to resolve a specific problem
	- Review workflow log timings to identify a any query that is taking a long time you can consider excluding it via a [CodeQL-config file](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-a-custom-configuration-file) 
		-  add a [query-filter](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-31-code-scanning-customize-your-codeql-analysis-using-query-filters/) to [exclude a specific query from analysis](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#excluding-specific-queries-from-analysis)
			
	- tweak the way CodeQL allocates memory to possibly make the workflow succeed in low memory conditions (for example, just below the runs-on field): [see sample](https://github.com/vulna-felickz/FullDotNetWebApp/pull/8/commits/263bbc8816a964d70f6267f6b6717f56b6bf6a1d)
		```yml
		env:
			CODEQL_ACTION_EXTRA_OPTIONS: '{"database": {"run-queries": ["--off-heap-ram=0"]}}'
		```


## Optimization - Caching Dependencies with GitHub Actions
  
 Depending on the number of dependencies, it may be faster to restore packages for your project using the Actions dependency cache. Projects with many large dependencies should see a performance increase as it cuts down the time required for downloading. Projects with fewer dependencies may not see a significant performance increase and may even see a slight decrease due to how NuGet installs cached dependencies. The performance varies from project to project. See [this article](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-net#caching-dependencies) for configuring the NuGet dependency cache.

## Vertical Scaling - Throw hardware at the software problem.  

Large applications can be compute/memory/disk bound as the default hosted runners are small instances (2core/8GBram/14GB SSD). Any repository approaching 100k lines of csharp code will benefit from bigger hardware.  See the [recommended hardware requirements for CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/recommended-hardware-resources-for-running-codeql) based on Codebase size.
-   On GitHub Actions, setup a [self-hosted CI action runner](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-an-organization) in your infrastructure that has some more powerful specs that can handle your large application. 
    - [Actions larger runners ](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-larger-runners) allows for up to a 64 core machine with 256GB RAM and 2040 GB of SSD storage
- On Azure DevOps Pipelines, setup a [self-hosted agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents) on your own hardware or Virtual Machine Scale Set agents.
		
## Horizontal Scaling - Continue to decompose your solution.  

Making an investment in optimizing your build process can drastically speed up your developer experience, CI pipelines and start the process of "decomposing the monolith".  Continued investment in large or legacy applications is important to keep your security posture and dependencies up to date. Review the suggestions for [using domain-driven design to modernize your monolithic application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/migrate-monolith).    If you have already investigated removing projects from your solutions that you do not wish to expose to a security scan (test projects / demo code), then you have already begun this journey.

A great use case would be to filter separate solutions by front end (ex: Web.sln) and back end code(ex: API.sln) that are separated by process/network boundaries.  CodeQL can detect data flows through the code but once it reaches a process boundary the flow is stopped.  This creates a natural separation point for both feature development teams and security scans based data flows.  This would further enable a decrease in wall-clock scan time by using parallel per-solution scans using an [Actions matrix strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-a-matrix-for-your-jobs) (such that each gets its own runtime and resources).  It will be important to include your common framework code in each solution so that you get a successful compilation while you further analyze other ways to share code.
